Music Player in JavaScript

Hey friends, today in this blog you’ll learn how to Create a Custom Music Player in JavaScript. We’ll use HTML CSS & Pure JavaScript to create this awesome music player. Earlier I also shared a JavaScript Project about How to Check Network Status using JavaScript and now it’s time to create a beautiful music player in JavaScript.

This project [Music Player in JavaScript] has several features such as you can loop, repeat or shuffle a song, play/pause a song or play the next or previous song. You can view your songs list and also know which song is currently playing and you can also select the song from the list to play. I have also created a video of this music player, you can watch a demo or full coding video.

Video Tutorial of Music Player in JavaScript


In the video, you have seen the beautiful music player and its several features as well as how I created it using only HTML CSS & JavaScript. I believe you love this music player and also understood some basic codes of this project. If you’re too beginner and you don’t have basic knowledge of JavaScript then definitely you won’t understand the codes of this project.

But if you know basic JavaScript then I have tried to explain each JavaScript line with written comments and please watch the video tutorial to understand easily and deeply. You may have a query on how to add more music to this player right? Well, you don’t need to do more things, just open the music-list.js duplicate the array items, and pass the music details there. I have also written comments in that file about this so don’t worry after downloading the source files of this music player you can easily do this.
